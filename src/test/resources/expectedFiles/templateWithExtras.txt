You need placeholders from multiple files in project directory resources/extras/parameters.properties to resolve this one.
from json: Hello from json!
Value from properties: Hello from properties!
from toml: Hello from toml!
from yaml: Hello from yaml!
from unknown: Hello from unknown!
This parameter is set via setExtras() and is never mentioned in config files: This is a value from test!

In this block array templating is verified.
Array from json: [el1, el2, el3, el4]
from properties: property files do not support arrays
from toml: [el1, el2, el3, el4]
from yaml: [el1, el2, el3, el4]
from unknown: [el1, el2, el3, el4]
This parameter is set via setExtras() and is never mentioned in config files: [This, is, an, array, from, test]

This parameter is set in toml but overridden in yaml: I am from yaml and also set in parameters.toml!

And this parameter is never set and geese should be together: ðŸª¿ðŸª¿
